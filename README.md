## Description

This project is called Salary Calculator and has two parts on the page. On the top of the page, with a header of Add Employee, will be input boxes for employee information. Beneath this with a header of Employees will be a table for the employee information.

An H1 tag was created for the "Salary Calculator" title of the site. 
 
 This project requires the design of a webpage that will take in employee information which consists of employee first name, last name, id, title and annual salary. There should be five fields to enter this information and a button to submit this information to a table on the DOM.
 
 An H2 tag was created for "Add Employee" and five input fields were created beneath the H2 tag. A submit button was created to have the input data displayed on the DOM and the fields are emptied after the button is clicked.
 
 The table on the DOM should have a row for each employee information and there should be a delete button to remove that row of customer information from the DOM. 
 The table on the DOM should have six columns with the following table headers: First Name, Last Name, ID, Title and Annual Salary. There is no header for the column where the delete button will be.

 An H2 tag was created for "Employees" with the table beneath the tag for the empoyee information. The table consists of six columns with the headers of First Name, Last Name, ID, Title and Annual Salary. There is no header for the sixth column which has a delete button for each employee's data.

There is a field for the Monthly Total. The total is a sum of the annual saleries of the employees calculated to a monthly total. If the monthly total exceeds $20,000.00 the field should have a background color of red.

A monthly total field was created which is a total of the annual salaries divided by two to give a monthly total. The decimal was changed to two fixed places. A check is in place to check the monthly total is greater than $20,000.00 the backgkround color will change to red.

A stretch goal is that when the employee data is removed the monthly total is adjusted.
